## Accessibility Class Overview

This course focuses on exploring input and interaction techniques, with a strong emphasis on universal design and alternative interfaces. We will be exploring into both traditional methods like keyboard and mouse input, as well as alternative techniques such as voice and eye gaze. The class involves practical aspects, including performance evaluations of existing techniques and the creation of prototypes for new interaction methods. Throughout the course, the design of technologies to support individuals with diverse abilities and disabilities will be a central theme.
